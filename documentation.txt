TOPIC - Troubleshoot Botâ€‹: A bot which can be asked questions about the an appliance and the
answer should come up from the manual or link to the manual topic. The questions will be in
natural language or they can be also with options derived from a problem or a solution tree. It
can also suggest best practices or operation manual about something.

Motivation - Everytime we have small query while using a software or while writing a code we have to go the internet to search for the query.
Sometimes we get lucky if someone already had the problem. But in most of the cases we don't type the exact query and the endup putting ourself in a tough situation.
With this chatbot we plan to reduce the time spent on querying the problem.

Features:
1: The chatbot is fully generative without the use of any API
2: We can easily move from one product to another(We just need training data)
3: We are trying to make as human as possible
